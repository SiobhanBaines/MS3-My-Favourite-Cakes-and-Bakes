# My Favourite Recipes

## Project Outline
The purpose of this project is to build a full-stack site that allows users to manage a set of data using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask, MongoDB and external API's. This site is a personal recipe site where favourite recipes can be uploaded and shared with other site visitors. These recipes can be family heirlomes handed down throught the generations or new favourites found in a magazine, book, online or even recommended by a friend or family. A database will be used to hold the recipes with a search function. To be able to add recipes to the site a user will need to register and create login credentials.

## Design Phase
### User Experience
1. **A new visitor to the site**
As a new visitor to the site I want to find some new recipes that other people love. I want the site to be easy to navigate, information to be easy to find and the site to be intuative. I would like to be able to create my own profile so that I can share my favourite recipes and store them in a convenient location.

2. **A regular visitor to the site**
I want to be able to see all recipes on the site, be able to add new recipes and potentially download a recipe or share it with a friend. If I decide to close my account I want the option to be able to delete the recipes I have contributed to the site.

### *Strategy*
A site where recipes can be loaded and shared by individuals creating a central repository where anyone can try something new or bake something that brings back child hood memories of being in Grandma's kitchen. The site will help remove the need for a book shelf full of cookery books. Thereby saving space, reducing clutter and creating a quick easy way to find something tastey to bake.

### *Scope*
[Project Design Mind Map](https://github.com/SiobhanBaines/MS3-My-Favourite-Recipes/blob/9f177456735fc658c3f85831a10604892c91f5da/documentation_files/recipes_mindmap.jpg)
The features to be included are
* The ability to select recipes by category
* The ability to create a profile which will allow the user to add/update their own recipes and contribute to the site
* The ability to download a recipe and/or email a recipe but only if the user has an existing profile
* If a user with a profile wishes to delete their account, the ability to decide if they want to delete their contribution

### *Structure*
How is the information structured, and is it logically grouped?
The navigation bar will change depending on the type of user visiting the site. 
Someone who does not have a profile will only be able to view the recipes and have the ability to register and login.
Someone who is already registered will 
* have the ability to see all the recipes they have created on a profile page
* have the abiltiy to add, change or delete any of the recipes they have contributed 
* have the abiltiy to delete their account 
* be able to print and/or email any of the recipes on the site

There will be the ability to select the recipes by category or for all categories. 
The categories will include 
* Fun with the children
* Tea time treat
* Special occasion
* What's for dinner
Recipes will be displayed in a card with an image of the final product. Clicking on the card will display all the ingredients, method, times, equipment etc and if the user is a registered user, the ability to download and/or email the recipes
