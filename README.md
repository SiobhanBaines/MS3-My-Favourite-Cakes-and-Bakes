# My Favourite Recipes

## Project Outline
The purpose of this project is to build a full-stack site that allows users to manage a set of data using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask, MongoDB and external API's. This site is a personal recipe site where favourite recipes can be uploaded and shared with other site visitors. These recipes can be family heirlomes handed down throught the generations or new favourites found in a magazine, book, online or even recommended by a friend or family. A database will be used to hold the recipes with a search function. To be able to add recipes to the site a user will need to register and create login credentials.

## Design Phase
### User Experience
1. **A new visitor to the site**
As a new visitor to the site I want to find some new recipes that other people love. I want the site to be easy to navigate, information to be easy to find and the site to be intuative. I would like to be able to create my own profile so that I can share my favourite recipes and store them in a convenient location.

2. **A regular visitor to the site**
I want to be able to see all recipes on the site, be able to add new recipes and potentially download a recipe or share it with a friend. If I decide to close my account I want the option to be able to delete the recipes I have contributed to the site.
